# Python Virtual Environment

## About Python Virtual Environment - **venv**

**venv** is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module.  
The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories.

## Install venv

In order to install `venv`, we need to install the following packages:

```shell title="apt example"
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

## Initialization of a Virtual Environment

Go to the root destination of your project and run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This will create a virtual environment in the current directory. The virtual environment folder will be named `.venv`.

## Activation of a Virtual Environment

In order to activate a virtual environment, from the root directory of your project, run the following command:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Check if the virtual environment is activated by running the following command:

```shell
which python
```

The output should be with `../.venv/bin/python` as the output.

Bonus:

You can add an alias to your bash profile to make it easier to activate the virtual environment:

```shell
alias activate='source .venv/bin/activate'
```

## Deactivation of a Virtual Environment

When you are done with the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following command:

```shell
deactivate
```
Or alternatively you can exit the current shell.
